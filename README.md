- [x] pipe
- [x] multiple pipe
- [ ] Display a prompt when waiting for a new command
- [x] Have a working history.
- [ ] Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path).
- [ ] Avoid using more than one global variable to indicate a received signal. Consider the implications: this approach ensures that your signal handler will not access your main data structures.
